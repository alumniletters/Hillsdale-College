# Open Letter to Hillsdale College

Even in the wake of a national uprising for racial justice in this nation, Hillsdale College has remained silent on the matter of Black Lives. It has been nearly five months since Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed while on a jog, four months since Breonna Taylor was murdered while in her own home, and weeks since George Floyd was choked to death by the knee of a police officer. These are only the most recent names of our fellow citizens lost, those we know of because their deaths were publicized. How many more lives have we lost, quietly, as we carried on with our lives? 

As an institution, you’re quite vocal about your founding by Free Will Baptists and abolitionists. A proud legacy of the school has always been that a higher percentage of Hillsdale students enlisted in the Civil War than from any other Michigan college, and some of those students even earned accolades. It is also well known and oft repeated that because of the college’s “anti-slavery reputation” many notable figures visited campus to speak, including Frederick Douglass and Edward Everett. 

The Civil War was over 150 years ago. Your students’ involvement in that revolt does not exempt you from any criticism of your treatment of people of color since. Reiterating that your students once fought for the Union Army is like saying that your ancestors didn’t personally own slaves so you’re not accountable for social reparations. Boasting that Frederick Douglass spoke on campus is like saying you have Black friends so you cannot be deemed racist. 

Hillsdale College: Pursuing Truth and Defending Liberty since 1844. The truth is that Black Americans are five times more likely to be incarcerated. The truth is that of the 1,098 people killed by police last year, 24% were Black (despite Black folks making up only 13% of our population). The personal liberties of Black and Brown citizens in this country are trampled on daily. To the Education department, what is your opinion on dismantling the school to prison pipeline? To the professors of Biology educating Pre-Med students, what do you have to say about the reality that Black women are four times more likely than white women to die during childbirth? Economics department, what is your opinion on the reality that Black women make 67 cents to the dollar that white men make? (More on that note: Native American women make 57 cents on the dollar, and Hispanic women make only 54) Politics is one of Hillsdale’s most popular majors - you are curating the minds of our nation’s future leaders. 

Say that Black Lives Matter, and that they will be protected by Hillsdale College and its graduates. (To be clear: this does not mean that you must endorse the Black Lives Matter organization, but a call for and promise to promote racial justice and equity is expected on all of the College's social media platforms - this is our request) 

In May of 2020, President Larry Arnn went to meet with Vice President Pence, with a panel of 13 other college Presidents and Deans, to discuss the reopening of higher education institutions in the Fall. Again, the Vice President selected only 14 leaders in education for this congress. Hillsdale College held court with the Second in Command of our country. What Hillsdale College stands for (or does not speak on) matters immensely. 

Your silence is evidence of your complicity and apathy on matters of racial equity. 

Your refusal to take a stand against the tyranny of our militarized police force is evidence of your abandonment of your founding principles. 

Your reticence during this time amounts to erasure. 

Your lack of a statement admonishing white supremacy is a silent consent. 

Other major institutions are reckoning with their place in this movement. You have the platform and ability to set a standard for your student body and faculty, Conservatives at large, and anyone who seeks to uphold the Good, True, and Beautiful. 

Sincerely,

All those undersigned
