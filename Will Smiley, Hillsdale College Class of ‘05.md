# Will Smiley, Hillsdale College Class of ‘05

I recently joined hundreds of other Hillsdale alumni in signing two open letters and a petition calling upon the college’s administration to recognize and condemn systemic racism and police brutality; to recognize and affirm that, in the face of these threats, black lives do matter. I was not entirely surprised that President Arnn has declined to issue such a statement. I was taken aback, however, by the college’s unsigned response, published in the Collegian. Hillsdale has already implicitly opposed racism through its actions, the administration claims, so no further statement is necessary. I find this argument, along with the stance of courageous defiance that the leadership assumes, unconvincing.

The college can be proud of its historical opposition to slavery and enforced segregation, as the open letters all noted. (I urge the Collegian to print at least one of them: I learned in Western Heritage that we must begin with primary sources.) But the administration’s other statements and actions are also important. Of course there has long been debate about Hillsdale turning down federal funds in order to avoid anti-discrimination reporting requirements. More recently, though, Hillsdale’s DC branch hired former NSC official Michael Anton as a lecturer and fellow. Anton is most famous for warning in 2016 that America was threatened by the “ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty.” I recently watched another Hillsdale in DC lecture in which college fellow Victor Davis Hanson rejoiced that his Mexican-American neighbors felt afraid after President Trump’s victory, calling this “deterrence.” And of course there is the outspoken support that Hillsdale’s most visible public representatives have given to President Trump, who manifests racism in his words, policies, and political alliances. In light of these messages, perhaps it is not so surprising that many alumni wish the college would, at the very least, affirm its opposition to racism, including systemic racism. 

The core of the administration’s response, however, is the claim that such an affirmation would be “jumping on cost-free bandwagons of public feeling.” Yet this is precisely backward. Which stance would really be costly? Certainly, the alumni who signed the open letters are probably saddened and angered that Hillsdale has rejected their request. Perhaps there will be some mean comments from liberals on Twitter. But this will not hurt the college much. I suspect most of the alumni who signed that letter don’t donate anyway. We are hardly a “totalitarian mob,” as a Federalist article (by a Hillsdale alum) called us. We’re just concerned alumni.

Let’s be honest about who really can impose costs on Hillsdale. For half a century, Presidents Roche and Arnn have sought to ensure what Russell Kirk, speaking for the college, called “its freedom from interference by interests or associations not related to the College by law and custom.” (Notably, he included alumni, but not donors, as “persons rightfully associated with the college” to whom Hillsdale owes duties.) Hillsdale College has very successfully created a network of donors that insulates the college from the power of the federal government, liberal elites, and mainstream public opinion. The college has over half a billion dollars in its endowment. But precisely because of that success, the administration cannot now plead persecution by those very groups. They cannot impose costs on Hillsdale.

However, Hillsdale’s independence brings with it a different set of responsibilities, and a different set of entanglements. It is the right-wing donor network, not the blue-check liberals on Twitter, who truly have power over the college. Hillsdale also gains immense benefits from its relationships with conservative politicians, and it has much to lose if it alienates either them or the donors. If Pres. Arnn were to say “black lives matter,” as Mitt Romney has, the college might be seen as betraying the conservative movement. Donations would probably drop. Perhaps Rush Limbaugh would be more hesitant to advertise the college, and Hugh Hewitt might cut back on the Hillsdale Dialogues. The Trump Administration could hire fewer alumni. Hillsdale might lose its seat at the table advising Mike Pence on how to respond to the coronavirus. The next time Congress is considering an endowment tax that would hurt the college, perhaps Sen. Pat Toomey would be a little slower in rushing to the senate floor to offer a last-minute amendment to exempt Hillsdale. So a “black lives matter” statement by Pres. Arnn would be anything but cost-free.

By contrast, avoiding such a statement is easy and even beneficial for the administration. Conservative outlets including The Federalist, PJ Media, the Washington Free Beacon, and The American Conservative have already lauded Hillsdale’s stance. I would not be surprised if donations to the college increase in the next few weeks (indeed The American Conservative article explicitly called for that). I therefore agree with the administration that “there is a kind of virtue that is cheap. It consists of jumping on cost-free bandwagons[.]” That applies as much among conservatives as it does among liberals. [Edit: since I wrote this, the college’s statement has been reprinted approvingly in The Wall Street Journal. The open letters have received no neutral or positive press coverage, even in the Collegian. Yet the administration claims that it is we, the alumni signing google docs, who have power over them, even as they grandstand for the national conservative press.]

From this perspective, we can see that the truly courageous move would be for the college leadership to take a position that the donor base would reject. (This does not, of course, mean that such a position would automatically be correct, though in this case I think it would be.) Yet this seems rare. Hillsdale’s leadership has recently been quite vocal about public affairs, from Pres. Arnn’s endorsement of Donald Trump to the recent YouTube series on the coronavirus. Indeed, even in its response to the open letters, the administration takes a donor-friendly position: “very real racial problems,” the leadership claims, “are now being cynically exploited for profit, gain, and public favor by some organizations and people.” That is a much stronger and more controversial statement than a simple affirmation that black lives matter and should be protected from police violence and racism. But I am sure it will not upset the donors. 

I am sure there are principled reasons for the college and the donors to come to similar conclusions. But my Hillsdale education taught me to be suspicious when principle and self-interest (including my own) seem to coincide perfectly. As one of my favorite professors liked to say, “It’s awfully convenient when God wants you to be rich.” I urge Pres. Arnn and the Board of Trustees to think about that. Perhaps what seems like the courageous choice, defying elite liberal opinion, is actually the easy choice. Perhaps the true threats to independent thinking and moral reasoning, the people who truly have the power to impose costs, are closer to home. Perhaps the donors who once offered the college independence from the government now impose a straitjacket of their own, even if it is a comfortable and often invisible one.

This is not an attack on the college. I have great respect for the professors, and fellow students, who taught me how to think and understand the world. I owe my career to the education I received at Hillsdale, and I credit both the faculty and the administration for that. But I am saddened and angered by the administration’s position, which does a disservice to the college. The hundreds of alumni who signed these letters are asking Hillsdale to think about race, and its relationship to racism in America, introspectively rather than defensively. This is the right thing to do, and it would uphold the college’s founding commitments. At times, that may require breaking from the mainstream of right-wing opinion. It could be costly. Independence often is, but strength rejoices in the challenge.
