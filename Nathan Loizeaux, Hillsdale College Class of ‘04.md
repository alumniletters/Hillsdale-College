Nathan Loizeaux, Hillsdale College Class of ‘04
Dear Dr. Arnn, and the administration of Hillsdale College,

A number of my fellow Hillsdale alums are fighting over the most ethical response to a petition - several petitions - concerning what the college should do or say, if anything, with regard to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Full disclosure, I signed the first one, which exhorted the college to speak out. I’ll gladly sign the others, but they’re multiplying rapidly, and I’ve lost track.

The response of the college, and conservative media in general, is awfully disappointing.

Please be clear on the timeline here. The first petition garnered about 250 signatures, and was afterwards flooded with fake names that grotesquely referenced genitalia, sexual assault, and, in one hideous case, the most famous suicide on campus. The alums involved thought it best to take it down, with consideration for the actual victims being mocked for sport.

Since then, the Collegian published a response, written by - I presume, given rumor and content - Dr. Arnn himself. That response has been picked up by a number of conservative news outlets, including the international Wall Street Journal, which printed the Collegian’s response verbatim. Myself, and the other 250-ish signers, have been denounced as an ‘outrage mob,’ accused of cheap virtue, and harangued by endless commenters that make special note of all the new donations they’re sending to Hillsdale.

The Collegian itself has refused to publish any other opinion on the matter, and this refusal comes concurrent with the WSJ’s publications (there were two).

If you read nothing else here, read this - the ease with which conservative outlets have lauded Hillsdale for standing up to an outrage mob of 250 people should show, above all else, that none of us, much less conservatives, are immune to the lazy comfort of information bubbles. My instructors at Hillsdale were a constant challenge to these of my own, and my hope is that the alum response to both the Collegian’s piece, and it’s repetition among conservative media, reflects the best of Hillsdale dialectic.

Which is to say, the conservative news bubble does not reflect the college. Certainly not all of us, and certainly not me.

I’ll keep this brief.

First, this was Hillsdale in the ‘70s.

These pictures are from the Winona, from 1972 to 1977. They are striking to my generation of Hillsdale alums for the simple reason that, in our day, no student housing, no matter how egalitarian, would ever be allowed to call itself ‘Ethnic House,’ nor would an organization like ‘Blacks United’ be tolerated several years running.

The college isn’t racist, and the lack of a ‘Blacks United’ house isn’t necessarily evidence of the contrary. I’ve debated the standard argument here, more or less, ‘Hillsdale hasn’t changed, but the world has.’ Maybe ‘Blacks United’ is too close to ‘Black Lives Matter,’ and it’s varied political associations, to last at present Hillsdale. But that has nothing to do with racism.

There’s still a problem. Saying that you’re adjusting sails because the current changed, not your course, yet means you’re changing something, and that always comes at a cost. In this case, the lack of a large enough minority student body to comfortably form a group called ‘Blacks United’ is, indeed, a loss, for the college and for myself.

Let me say that again, at the risk of making this all about me, and at greater risk of implying that minority students are no more than a prop for my own enrichment - it was my loss. It is one thing to hear different opinions, and quite another to witness diverse human beings responding, processing, accepting, rejecting, and arguing those opinions in real time. The latter grows empathy in a way the former does not. I can personally attest to this.

In short, Hillsdale without ‘Blacks United’ is lesser for it. Lesser, certainly, than a Hillsdale without the still struggling College Democrats. I had neither. I wish I had attended a Hillsdale with both.

Second, I’d like to be blunt about ‘cheap virtue.’

Let’s be honest. I risk nothing by writing this, save a few angry family members. You risk more, because speaking for the college always brings with it monetary considerations, as well as value judgments. I respect this, and I mean it. It may sound cynical to factor money into a decision about values, but the fact is, without money, there’s no college. It’s hardly cynical to factor in oxygen when determining just where and how deep to scuba dive.

But you are wrong about the cheap virtue of protestors. They risk the most. I’ve seen my friends participate in protests. I’ve seen them lose something, and watched others lose everything, for the sake of this movement.

And, frankly, it’s fallacious to assume my political opponent has impure motives while only ascribing good ones to my political allies. I should no more assume that money is the administration’s only concern than that being popular is the only concern of Hillsdale social justice warriors. The Collegian piece, as popular as it was, reasoned poorly, and the logic it used just as well condemns the administration for greed as it does protestors for fame.

Ignore my irritation with the Collegian, though - I risk nothing, and you risk something, and protestors risk more. Therefore, I can’t presume to understand your position, or the position of protestors. You risk the college’s security, and protestors risk their bodies and lives.

But I’ll note this: you do have one thing in common: you both have problems that, frankly, are wonderful to have. Risking the loss of money and prestige for speaking the truth likely means that you have a lot of money and prestige to risk. Risking the disdain of half of American politics because your movement has become popular means that you might actually have enough support to get something done. Despite the bandwagoners. Perhaps because of the bandwagoners, both yours and mine.

You and the protestors have a common question: in a position of power, how do you make your next move?

I can’t answer for you. I’m not risking anything. You’re risking more. But maybe it’s best to make your decision on who is risking the most.

Black Americans, and poor Americans, and especially poor Black Americans, have suffered under the inadequacies of our criminal justice and policing systems for centuries. There’s now enough momentum to make several positive changes. Among those changes should be, in my opinion, the affirmation that if Black Lives Matter, because all lives matter, then Black Lives deserve a liberal arts education, regardless of their political affiliation or economic status. Hillsdale has stated this time, and time again. Surely it can state it one more time, when the crux of the question turns not on the ability of a black American to receive tuition at Hillsdale, but on the ability of an arrested black American to breathe.

Love and respect,

Nathan Loizeaux, alum ‘04
