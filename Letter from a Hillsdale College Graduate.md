# Letter from a Hillsdale College Graduate

One hundred and seventy-six years ago, Hillsdale College was founded by abolitionists, who wrote in the charter that the college would not discriminate based on race, religion, or sex. Four hundred of your students fought for the Union, and over sixty of them died fighting for the unity of the country and the lives and rights of Black Americans. Frederick Douglass and Edward Everett spoke on your campus. Yours is a college founded to preserve and model the principles of our Judeo-Christian and Western heritage to the world – principles such as equality, the sanctity of life, and self-government under the law. 

Where is that college now? Where is your voice, one that previously shouted for the rights and freedoms of all Americans? 

Hillsdale College, your silence on our country’s ongoing struggle with racism and the deprivation of Black Americans’ constitutional rights is deafening. You tout Christian values and bravery in the face of dissent, and yet you refuse to speak up for those in need of your voice now. You say you value civil discourse, yet you refuse to join one of the most important conversations of this century. Your history does not speak for itself. You have a voice and a platform, yet you hide behind weak platitudes. Your current words, and lack of thereof, matter greatly for your integrity and legacy. 

For decades, the police construct in this country has harassed, targeted, and discriminated against minority populations of all types, but especially against the Black community. The statistics speak for themselves. Black Americans are more likely to be questioned, incarcerated, and killed by police. The sixth highest cause of death for young Black men in America is death by police use-of-force. Black men fill prisons at exponentially higher rates than white men. If “Hillsdale College maintains ‘by precept and example’ the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith,” then how does it feel about a police state and judicial system that denies Black Americans’ God-given image and rips their families apart? Does this not offend your Christian values? 

Police violence and criminal justice reform are not simply “social justice” matters. They are issues of basic liberty: liberties that are being denied to large swaths of our fellow citizens.

When a group of civil servants can without consequence repeatedly threaten, menace, and take the lives of any group of Americans, but particularly the most vulnerable of us, we are all endangered. 

When police chiefs can threaten to walk off the job or ignore calls from the needy when their budgets are questioned, we are all endangered. 

When individuals cannot be held civilly accountable for their actions, which include taking the life of their fellow countrymen whose skin tone might be slightly darker than their own, we are all endangered. 

When police departments obscure records, refuse to release information, and regularly erase the transgressions of their officers, we are all endangered. 

When armed officers can burst into homes of Americans, murder sleeping innocents, and deny the Second Amendment rights of others, we are all endangered. 

When our judicial system can lock away entire generations of young Black men with so little fanfare and call it justice, we are all endangered. 

We implore you to use your Christian values, abiding defense of liberty, and incredible platform to stand up for the rights of your fellow Black Americans who are hurting, targeted, and otherwise disenfranchised. We encourage you to speak out against the police violence that threatens the liberties and God-given freedoms of every American. We beg you, the administration of Hillsdale College, to live up to your historical commitment: “May earth be better and heaven be richer because of the life and labor of Hillsdale College.” 

Until Hillsdale speaks up on this matter, it does not fulfill this promise. Do not tarnish your legacy and the legacy of your alumnae. Do not let politics of the day override your commitment to uphold the Good, the True, and the Beautiful. Set the standard for your students, your faculty, your donors, and all conservatives who see you as a shining city on a hill. Black lives do matter. They mattered 176 years ago, and they matter today. Strength rejoices in the challenge, and we the undersigned challenge you to do better.
